# react-employee-directory
Traversing an employee directory with React.js

## Features
* rendering a RandomUser API call within react inside a table
* filtering and sorting the table

## Reasoning
Rendering information conditionally and within the sleek framework of React is an important tool for full stack developers; particularly given the current popularity and brimming job market for `React.js`.
This assignment was an exercise in handling data from an API and rendering it in a variety of fashions based on user input.

## Challenges & Process
1. Filtering and Mapping the data proved to be the biggest obstacle for me. I think that the way I have gone about it, although it does work, is probably a fairly poor implementation of it. Nevertheless it did what I wanted it to do.

2. Handling state at different levels also took me a long time to figure out. Initially I was using `class` based models but then I switched to functions with hooks, which was harder at first but made handling state much easier over time.

3. Speaking of state, in the beginning I had many problems with where and how to handle state - initially I was handling it within components but once I moved it out into App.js and passed it down with props I was in the clear.
